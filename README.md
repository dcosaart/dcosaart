- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcosaart, with two ss's, oops.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about AI and using it to my advantage.  Furthermore, I wish to dive deeper into working with API's and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web programming languages like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP.  Also, working with databases, and, in the near future, Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on website creation projects, using REACT and other resources.  Additionally, with projects involving AI.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love animal memes, especially dogs and cats.  But not the old 2012 ones, the recent ones or funny videos of them.
